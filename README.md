# Translations for K-Manager and K-Klock


# Getting Localisation

* Fork or download this repo
* Find the localisation code for the language you want to translate. 
  * [See here.](https://stackoverflow.com/a/12735102) 
  * Only the part before the underscore is needed in most cases. For example, French would be fr.
  * To specify a region use the form xx-rXX. For example, French, Canada (fr_CA) would be fr-rCA.

# Translating Values

* Make a new folder called values-<localisation>. For example, values-fr
* Copy all the files from the values folder into your values-<localistion> folder.
* Open the files and translate everything inside <xyz></xyz> tags.
  * %s is a placeholder for a word. 
  * Don't change the order of tags.

# Translating html

* Make a new folder inside the html folder called <localisation>. For example html/fr
* Copy all the html files from the html folder into your folder.

# Get Credit

* Go to arrays.xml and add your name to the translators array!
* Like <item>Your Name</item>
* You can add a href with a link if you want. 
* For example <item><a href="link">Your name</a><item>
* And thanks for helping! :)
